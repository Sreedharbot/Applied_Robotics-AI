> This repo is created for storing assignments

In this repository, I will be storing webot simulation file. Also will be creating new version from the existing file.


The Task for this assignnment,

    '''
      Part - 1

       * Create a Webot simulation using e-puck robot.
       * In the enivronment, create a 3 boxes of RGB (Red , Green , Blue) code.
       * E-puck should identiy the color of the box using its camera sensor.
       * It should print a string in console like "Found --- box " -> 1-time.
       * It should  also print a string in console like "Pervious Found --- box " -> 1-time by storing the value.
      
      Part -2
      
       * Create an CNN Model
       * Recoginze 3 images, and show the developed CNN model able to recogonize the image.
       * With webot, use the CNN model to recogonize the image in the webot world.
